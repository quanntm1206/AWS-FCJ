You can also create Custom Lenses for internal standards. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Review Templates & Profiles: Help standardize reviews by pre-filling common answers (Templates) and prioritizing questions based on business goals (Profiles). <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Jira Integration: Allows you to sync improvement items directly from the Well-Architected Tool into your Jira projects as epics, tasks, and sub-tasks for streamlined tracking. <br>&emsp; **+ Security:** <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Shared Responsibility Model: AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, while you are responsible for securing your workloads in the cloud. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • IAM Integration: Access is controlled through AWS IAM, with pre-built policies for full access and read-only access. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Data Protection: Recommends using IAM users (not root), enabling MFA, and avoiding placing sensitive data in free-form text fields. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Monitoring & Auditing: Integrates with AWS CloudTrail to log all API activity and with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automated notifications.  | 19/09/2025 | 20/09/2025      | [Lab 10](https://000010.awsstudygroup.com/) <br><br> [Lab 8](https://000008.awsstudygroup.com/) <br><br> [Lab 14](https://000014.awsstudygroup.com/) <br><br> [Vietnam Cloud Day Experience](4-EventParticipated/4.1-Event1/) <br><br> [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html) |


### Week 2 Achievements:

* Successfully completed core labs in Module 3 (focused on RDS, Load Balancing) and made significant progress in Module 4.

* Utilized Linux via EC2 to install and run a MySQL database and deploy a connected web application, successfully hosting the database using RDS (Relational Database Service).

* Successfully set up a Load Balancer and Target Groups, and adapted to a discontinued tool by installing and using Siege on an EC2 instance to execute a load test.

* Configured Route 53 endpoints and rules for a hybrid DNS setup, including the deployment of Microsoft AD.

* Gained foundational knowledge in cloud monitoring by viewing metrics and graphs in CloudWatch, configuring Alarms and Dashboards, and learning the basics of log management.

* Team Support: Assisted team members with labs, identifying and helping to correct missing steps in the lab instructions.

* Attended the AWS Cloud Day 2025 HCM Event (Gen AI and Data track).

* Optional Research: Completed research on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, documenting its purpose, usage steps, key features (Lenses, Templates, Profiles), and security considerations.

* Technical Setup: Successfully installed Ubuntu on a machine and reformatted the worklog for improved presentation.
