### Week 4 Achievements:

* Completed a comprehensive review of core database concepts including RDBMS, keys, indexes, partitioning, OLTP/OLAP, and AWS-specific database services.

* Gained theoretical knowledge of the features and use cases for AWS RDS, Amazon Aurora (e.g., Backtrack, Global Database), Amazon Redshift (Data Warehouse for OLAP), and Amazon ElastiCache (caching with Redis/Memcached).

* Database Migration: Attempted a complex database migration lab, demonstrating resourcefulness by:

  *  Sourcing a custom MSSQL Database and installing necessary services on an EC2 instance due to broken lab guides.

  *  Successfully migrating the custom MSSQL database to MySQL using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).

* Identified and addressed the issue of expired AWS credits by raising a support case.

* Secured continuation of lab work by setting up an IAM User with admin privileges on a team member's account.

* Formulated a proposal for the team's upcoming workshop with teammates.

* Completed the translation of three blogs.

* Attended the AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering event.
