### Week 6 Achievements:

* Proposal Refinement:

  * Completed multiple revisions of the workshop proposal, shift from a custom Lambda function to using GuardDuty for intrusion detection.

  * Successfully recalculated and reduced estimated costs by optimizing the EC2 instance type and active hours.   

  * Translated to markdown, and deployed the proposal draft to GitHub Pages.

* Architecture and System Updates:

  * Revised the AWS Architecture diagram, incorporating GuardDuty, EventBridge, and refining icon arrangements and subnet groups for clarity and accuracy.

  * Updated the worklog and successfully deployed the refined worklog to GitHub Pages.

  * Installed AmazonQ.

* Attended the online seminar **'DX<inAction> Talk#7: Reinventing DevSecOps with AWS Generative AI'**.

* Compiled study materials for the midterm exam.
