# OSPAR 2025 report: 170 services in scope based on enhanced OSPAR v2.0 guidelines

We’re pleased to announce the completion of our annual **AWS Outsourced Service Provider’s Audit Report (OSPAR)** audit cycle on August 7, 2025, based on the newly enhanced version 2.0 guidelines (**OSPAR v2.0**). AWS is the first global cloud service provider in Singapore to obtain the report using the new OSPAR v2.0 guidelines.

## ABS Guidelines and OSPAR v2.0 Standards

The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) established the *Guidelines on Control Objectives and Procedures for Outsourced Service Providers* (ABS Guidelines) to provide baseline controls criteria that outsourced service providers (OSPs) operating in Singapore should have in place.

> ABS enhanced the ABS Guidelines to **version 2.0**, which OSPs—such as AWS—need to comply with for the audit period commencing on or after January 1, 2025.

The enhanced ABS Guidelines integrate key elements from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory updates on:
* Cyber hygiene
* Technology risk management
* Business continuity management

Additionally, it includes new control domains such as data security, cryptography, and software application development and management.

## Expanded Scope: 170 Services

The 2025 OSPAR certification cycle includes the addition of **seven (7) new services** in scope, bringing the total number of services in scope to **170** in the AWS Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region.

**Newly added services in scope include:**
* Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
* Amazon Security Lake
* Amazon Verified Permissions
* AWS Payment Cryptography
* AWS Resource Explorer
* AWS Verified Access
* AWS Wickr

Successfully completing the OSPAR assessment demonstrates that AWS continues to maintain a robust system of controls to meet these guidelines. This underscores our commitment to fulfill the security expectations for cloud service providers set by the financial services industry in Singapore.

Customers can use OSPAR to streamline their due diligence processes, thereby reducing the effort and costs associated with compliance. OSPAR remains a core assurance program for our financial services customers because it is closely aligned with local regulatory requirements from MAS.
