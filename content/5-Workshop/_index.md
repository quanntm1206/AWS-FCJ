# AWS Auto Incident Response System Setup

#### Overview

This guide provides a complete, step-by-step procedure for deploying our automated incident response and forensic system in AWS. This system leverages **CloudTrail**, **GuardDuty**, **VPC Flow Logs**, **Kinesis Firehose**, **Glue**, **Athena**, and **Lambda** functions orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions** to automatically detect, analyze, and quarantine compromised resources like EC2 instances and IAM users. Futher log forensics capacity is added by setting up a **Security Dashboard** hosted on S3 and accessed via **CloudFront** and **Cognito**, query log using **API Gateway** and **Lambda**.
