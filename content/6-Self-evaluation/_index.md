During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **12/08/2025** to **12/11/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **Cloud Computing & DevOps projects**, specifically focusing on **Serverless Log Analytics** and **Hybrid Cloud Architectures**, through which I improved my skills in **AWS Cloud Services implementation (EC2, S3, Lambda, Athena), System Monitoring (CloudWatch), and Infrastructure Automation**.  

In terms of work ethic, I always aim to complete tasks well and complied with workplace regulations. I consistently **maintained a polite, respectful attitude** towards everyone and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency. I prioritized attendance at the office and eagerly participated in all company technical workshops to broaden my industry knowledge.

### Needs Improvement

* **Deepen Technical Expertise:** Although I have grasped the fundamentals, I need to further strengthen my in-depth understanding of complex architectures and debugging skills to handle advanced technical issues more independently.
* **Enhance Problem-Solving Thinking:** I aim to improve my logical approach to troubleshooting, moving from trial-and-error to a more systematic root cause analysis method.
* **Refine Communication Skills:** I will focus on articulating technical concepts more clearly and confidently in professional contexts to better convey ideas during team discussions and presentations.
